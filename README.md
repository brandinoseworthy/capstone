<h1>Problem</h1>

As a parent that stays home or works - it can be hard to navigate where other kids are playing, even in your own town if you are not friends with the other parents. Which can make socializing your child at any age difficult. 

# Solution

Create a playdate post site where parents can post where they will be if they are open for others to be there too. THe point of this site is not to make 'fixed' friends - but to be able to see where kids will be at a certain location, date, and time so a parent can decide to take their kids there. A parent will sign up their child for the playdate post, so others can see that others kids will be in that area too. This will give children the opportunity to grow their social circle and social skills in a more authentic way and hopefully you and your child will make friends during your outings!
